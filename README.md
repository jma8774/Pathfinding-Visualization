# Pathfinding Visualization

For those that stumble upon this, I created this website because I struggled with visualizing what each algorithm did in my head. And if struggle like me, then perhaps this can help you a little bit. Hope you enjoy!

# Algorithms

* **Breadth-First Search:** A search algorithm that visits all nodes in the level before proceeding to the next level. It is unweighted and guarantees the shortest path.
* **Depth-First Search:** A search algorithm that finishes visiting a whole depth before looking at other depths. It is unweighted and is not efficient at pathfinding
* **Bidirectional Search:** A search algorithm that in a sense, makes use of 2 BFS. One from the source node and one from the end node. It is unweighted and guarantees the shortest path.
* **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** The most famous search algorithm, it is weighted and that is guarantees that you will get the shortest path and the path with the least cost.
* **A-Star Search:** A version of Dijkstra's algorithm that makes use of a heuristic function that predicts which path is the best to take. Arguably the best pathfinding algorithm out there.
